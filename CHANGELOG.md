# 2016-04-26 - v3.0.0

#### Improvements

* We've made it much easier to integrate the Apptentive Android SDK into your app. Now, just add a single line to your `build.gradle`, and one to your `Application` class. If you are migrating from a prior version, make sure to follow our simple [Migration Guide](https://github.com/apptentive/apptentive-android/blob/master/docs/migrating_to_3.0.0.md).
* Our SDK's UI will now inherit all styles from your app, as long as you are using an AppCompat or Material theme. If you want to further customize our UI, or you aren't using an AppCompat or Material theme, you can override our styles. Check out our [UI Customization Guide](https://docs.apptentive.com/android/customization/).
* Our Surveys have been completely redesigned to use Material design. Your existing surveys will continue to work as before, but will look much better.
* You can now launch our UI without passing in an Activity. This is useful for recording Events and showing Interactions from a Service or BroadcastReceiver. Interactions launched in this way will launch in a new task, while those launched with an Activity Context will launch on top of the Activity stack as before.
* Other improvements include reducing sdk memory footprint and more accurate application lifecycle management.


# 2016-03-22 - v2.1.4

* You've always had the ability to send custom data in the Person, Deveice, Message, and Event objects. However, you can now send custom data that is a Number or Boolean, and use that custom data in your Interaction targeting logic.

# 2015-09-15 - v2.0.1

#### Bugs Fixed

* Fixed a [potentially conflicting resource name. [Issue 105](https://github.com/apptentive/apptentive-android/issues/105)

# 2015-09-09 - v2.0.0

#### Improvements

* Message Center: We've completely rebuilt Message Center from the ground up. Our new Message Center uses Material Design throughout, and features streamlined and optimized behavior to help you get feedback from your customers, or start conversations. Message Center is now much more configurable from the server, so you can make changes to text and behavior after you release your app.
* Apptentive Push: We can now send push notifications to your GCM enabled device without going through a third party push provider. See the [integrations section](https://be.apptentive.com/apps/current/settings/integrations), and check out the [documentation](http://www.apptentive.com/docs/android/integration/#push-notifications).

# 2012-09-13 - v0.5.2

#### Bugs fixed

* ANDROID-84 Remove checked in API keys from the Android repository
* ANDROID-85 Example app has API key in the resources file, but also requires updating the manifest
* ANDROID-89 Add callback after survey completion

# 2012-09-12 - v0.5.1

#### Major changes

* There was a problem with how we initialize our SDK that could lead to NPEs if the main Activity had been garbage collected, and interfered with unit testing individual child Activities. Fixed that.
* Fixed a problem with how we check for app uses. Now we keep track of each Activity instead of the Application as a whole.

#### Bugs fixed

* ANDROID-83: App crashes when no permissions are set for the app
* ANDROID-88: Android initialization needs rework

# 2012-08-15 - v0.5.0

#### Major changes

* Updated what counts as a "use". Before, we were incrementing uses on app launch, defined as a call to the main Activity's onCreate() method. That is not very useful, since hitting home screen backgrounds the app, but won't increment uses upon return. So instead, we figure out when the app is put into the background, and when it comes back.
* Updated app integration process. Instead of making a bunch of Apptentive API calls, you can now inherit from our ApptentiveActivity or ApptentiveListActivity. These classes allow you to save time integrating. You can also delegate your Activity's event handlers into Apptentive manually if you can't inherit from us.
* Redid the example apps. The previous "Demo" app was not really a demo, but a testing app. Renamed it accordingly. Also added two new "Example" apps: one using inheritance for integration, and the other using delegation.


#### Bugs fixed

* ANDROID-79: Add Changelog
* ANDROID-78: Externalize strings
* ANDROID-77: Send UUID with survey response - Android
* ANDROID-76: Check out using a res bundle for apptentive configuration.

* ANDROID-61: If an API key isn't specified, return a better error message
* ANDROID-60: Survey answer options that are more than one line don't display well
* ANDROID-56: Send survey time to completion with responses
* ANDROID-55: Disable Ratings Flow when ratings_enabled preference is false
* ANDROID-35: Don't start rating flow when no data connection is present
